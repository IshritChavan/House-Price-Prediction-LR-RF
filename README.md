# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest

This project involves predicting housing prices using a dataset with features like total rooms, bedrooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. The pipeline includes:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming skewed data using log transformations.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features like bedroom-to-room ratio and household-to-room ratio.
- Data Visualization: Heatmaps and scatterplots to explore correlations.
- Model Building: Implementing Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV for optimizing Random Forest.
- Evaluation: Model performance evaluated through R-squared scores.
